# Dual-Domain Siamese Network for Robust Pneumonia Detection via Radiographic Texture and Anatomical Region Comparison

### ðŸ©º Pneumonia Detection via Siamese Network with LBP Texture Fusion

This project carries out a deep learning pipeline for binary classification of chest X-ray images into the categories of Pneumonia and Normal. It employs the dual-branch Siamese Neural Network (SNN) architecture for comparison between the left and right lung views by utilizing paired processing. The model augments texture information by incorporating Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to capture radiographic differences between healthy lungs and infected ones.


Key features of the project:

- ðŸ§  DenseNet-based Siamese Network for dual-lung embedding comparison

- ðŸ“Š Local Binary Pattern (LBP) maps fused as a second channel

- ðŸŽ¯ Cosine Embedding Loss to learn visual similarity between pairs

- ðŸ’¡ Hard Negative Mining to train on more challenging dissimilar pairs

- ðŸ“ˆ Training and Validation curves saved in PDF format

- âœ… Early stopping and best checkpoint saving to prevent overfitting

- ðŸ§ª Evaluation metrics including accuracy and confusion matrix
